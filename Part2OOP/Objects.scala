  singleton objects. A singleton is a class that can have only one instance, i.e., Object. You create singleton using
  the keyword object instead of class keyword. Since you can't instantiate a singleton object, you can't pass parameters
  to the primary constructor.
  class --> A class is a blueprint for objects. Once you define a class, you can create objects from the class blueprint
  with the keyword new. Through the object you can use all functionalities of the defined class.
